The project focuses on apply Genetic Algorithms (GA) to solve a complex scheduling problem: the **Music Festival Lineup Optimization**. The objective is to design an optimal festival schedule by assigning artists to stages and time slots in a way that maximizes artist popularity during prime time, ensures genre diversity, and minimizes fan base conflicts.
